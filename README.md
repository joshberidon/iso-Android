# iso-Android

## Development cycle

1. Checkout new branch from develop
  - Name style feature/"your name"/#Issue#-short-description
  - "your name" is especially optional - useful for issues that take multiple people to solve though
  
2. Push to origin/your-branch-name
  - Make a pull request to develop
  - Have merge checked by someone else
  - Merge if everything looks okay
  
### Please make useful commit messages :)
